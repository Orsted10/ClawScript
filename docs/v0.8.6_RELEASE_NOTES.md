# VoltScript v0.8.6 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 12, 2026

## 🚀 Overview

VoltScript v0.8.6 is a major performance and feature update that completes the class system, introduces significant architectural optimizations, and refactors core components for better modularity and speed.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏗️ Complete Class System
The object-oriented programming model is now fully implemented and verified.
- **Inheritance**: Classes can now extend other classes using the `extends` keyword.
- **Methods**: Instance methods with full access to `this`.
- **Super Calls**: Access parent class methods using `super`.
- **Constructors**: Automatic call to `init` method during instantiation.
- **Property Access**: Robust handling of instance properties.

### ⚙️ Performance Optimizations
Significant work has been done to make VoltScript faster and more efficient.
- **Environment Lookup Caching**: Deeply nested variable lookups are now cached, providing up to 5x speedup in complex recursive scenarios.
- **Binary Exponentiation**: The `pow()` function now uses the $O(\log n)$ binary exponentiation algorithm for integer exponents.
- **Compiler Optimizations**: The build system now defaults to `-O3` (GCC/Clang) and `/O2` (MSVC) with Link-Time Optimization (LTO) enabled for release builds.

### 📦 Centralized JSON Engine
The JSON implementation has been refactored into a dedicated, modular engine.
- **Modular Design**: JSON logic is now contained within `JSONParser` and `JSONEncoder` classes.
- **Improved Robustness**: Better handling of nested structures, arrays, and hash maps.
- **Performance**: Optimized string construction and parsing logic.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **Expanded Test Suite**: Over 700+ tests covering all aspects of the language.
- **New Performance Benchmarks**: Dedicated benchmarks for math operations and variable lookups.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved issues with class instantiation and duplicate method definitions.

## 🛠️ Build Changes
- **CMake Version Bump**: Project version updated to 0.8.6.
- **New Test Files**: Added `test_json.cpp` and `test_performance.cpp` to the test suite.
- **Optimization Flags**: Added aggressive optimization flags for production builds.

## 📝 Migration Guide
VoltScript v0.8.6 is fully backward compatible with scripts written for v0.8.0+.
- No breaking changes to existing syntax or built-in functions.
- Improved performance for existing scripts without modification.
