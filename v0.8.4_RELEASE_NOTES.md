# VoltScript v0.8.4 - Stack Trace Support

## New Features
- **Runtime Stack Traces**: All runtime errors now include a full stack trace showing the call chain, function names, and line numbers.
- **Stack Overflow Protection**: Added a configurable maximum call depth (default: 1000) to prevent engine crashes from infinite recursion.
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Improved error messages across the interpreter with consistent formatting and location tracking.

## Technical Improvements
- **CallStack Management**: New `CallStack` and `StackFrame` classes for efficient tracking of function execution.
- **Double Dispatch Implementation**: Leveraged the Visitor pattern to ensure all AST nodes correctly report errors through the stack trace system.
- **Increased Stack Size**: Updated build configuration to support deeper recursion depths on Windows/MSVC.
- **Clean Build System**: Enabled strict compiler warnings and AddressSanitizer support for improved code quality.

## Verification
- Passed all 566 existing regression tests.
- Verified stack trace accuracy with deep call chains and recursive functions.
- Confirmed stack overflow protection triggers at the defined limit.
- Benchmarked performance overhead to be negligible (<1%).
